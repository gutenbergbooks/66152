<p>This Report contains a summary of the investigations of a
Committee reappointed by the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, at Manchester, in 1887, to consist of
Professor Newton, Mr J. A. Harvie-Brown, Mr John Cordeaux,
Mr W. Eagle Clarke, Mr R. M. Barrington, and Mr A. G. More,
for the purpose of obtaining (with the consent of the Master
and Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, the Commissioners of
Northern Lights, and the Commissioners of Irish Lights) observations
on the Migration of Birds at Lighthouses and Light-ships,
and of reporting on the same at Bath in 1888. Mr
Cordeaux to be the Secretary.</p>

<p>The returns relating to Scotland have been arranged by Mr
J. A. Harvie-Brown; for the East Coast of England, by Mr
Cordeaux; for the West Coast of England, by Mr W. Eagle
Clarke; and those for the Coasts of Ireland, by Mr R. M.
Barrington and Mr A. G. More.</p>

<p>This is the ninth, and final, report issued, and the Committee
have much pleasure in stating that one of their number, Mr
William Eagle Clarke, of the Museum of Science and Art
in Edinburgh, has undertaken the laborious task of reducing
the mass of facts collected, from an examination <i>de novo</i> of the
whole of the schedules sent in, so as to bring out the general
results of their inquiry, both statistically and otherwise, on
strictly scientific lines, and in as condensed and clear a method
as possible.</p>

<p class="caption4nb"><i>Extracts from Diary from the Stations.</i></p>

<p>The following notes are selected from a large number of
letters and notes, showing the constantly increasing interest
taken in the work of the Committee:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>N. Unst.</i>&mdash;John Nichol (principal) says: "Ravens variously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">- 3 -</span>
marked were seen in June and July near Lerwick. One was
jet black with white wings. Another white head and tips of
wings. Others variously marked.</p>

<p>"Teal and Widgeon, reckoned rare in Unst, seen 23d November.
The Starling is not of the Faroe species, but of the
common species. Took particular note of this. Breed. Make
for shore in winter at night&mdash;only with us during the day.
Fewer land birds in 1887 than in most seasons, except greater
numbers of Linnets (Twites?) in day time. Stormy Petrels were
the most persistent night-callers we had. More Cormorants
than usual in winter and more Eider Ducks than in former
years. No Swans seen to date of 31st December 1887. Strange
fact noted: No Solan Geese seen between October 28th and
November 20th, although for certain there were plenty of fish
about, and the weather fine."</p>

<p>Under date of March 7th, Mr Nichol in a letter describes
a whale chase. Two large Finners off the shore of Balta V&ouml;e
(<i>Physeter tursio</i>), estimated at over 70 feet long. Not captured.</p>

<p>On 20th March a large Eagle pounced on a Hooded Crow
and carried him off, flying past going north. In August
occur records of Eagles on Hermann's Hill. Young had been
destroyed [<i>by the selfish edict then in force.</i>&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]. A
Little Auk, Mr Nichol says, "measured 8&frac12; inches from point of
beak to tip of tail," which is over the measurements in Johns'
Book, which he has. [We are glad to find such care taken
as this indicates.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] Greater number of Gulls
seen than usual in September, indicating greater abundance
of fish.</p>

<p>"On the 24th December," says Mr Nichol, "at 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;a
rare occurrence&mdash;a flock of six Cormorants appeared, same time
another flock of six. Both flocks flying round the rock one
after the other. After once round, the hindermost flock went
right away westerly. The other went three times more round
the rock, as if looking for the other flock, <i>before leaving also
westerly</i>. [Italics are mine.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] To date 31st December.
Not one been seen since, although before daily."</p>

<p>Mr Nichol relates another whale hunt at Unst, on Wednesday,
28th September 1887. Also unsuccessful.</p>

<p>I must pay a passing tribute to the admirable schedules
sent in by Mr Nichol, including two entirely devoted, as requested,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">- 4 -</span>
to movements of Solan Geese, which are sure to yield,
some day, valuable information.</p>

<p><i>Sumburgh Head.</i>&mdash;Mr James Youngclause.&mdash;A very short
single schedule. Birds very scarce. Greenfinch found dead on
9th December. Mentions <i>residents</i> there, which may yet be
utilised for minute records of distribution. Arrival and departure
of rock birds&mdash;not one seen after the 12th August.
No "rushes" of birds seen. (Assistant's name, Donald Campbell.)</p>

<p><i>North Ronaldshay.</i>&mdash;John Tulloch.&mdash;Great numbers of Gulls
on the Island all winter, living mostly in the turnip fields.
"There are 100's (<i>sic</i>) to be seen in a field at times, feeding.
They will hollow the turnip, leaving the outside skin only.
The only way to keep them away is to shoot some, and hang
them up on poles."</p>

<p><i>Pentland Skerries.</i>&mdash;John Gilmour (assistant keeper&mdash;not
"principal," as in last Report).</p>

<p>The Crossbill occurs (see letter of 2d August 1887, and
schedule under date&mdash;22d July being date of occurrence).&mdash;"There
were three of them on the island, and they remained over
a week. This is in no mistake a rare bird here, and I have
never seen it before."</p>

<p>"A Game Hawk was on the island a good part of the
summer, and made sad havoc among the Terns" (schedule, 10th
August 1887). This may partially account for the shifting of
nesting sites of the Terns so frequently, to which we allude elsewhere
("Vertebrate Fauna of the Outer Hebrides," <i>in the press</i>.
David Douglas).</p>

<p>[Two of the schedules refer entirely to Solan Geese, as requested.
These from the various stations should be separately
considered and reported upon in the final digest.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]
They bulk about the Pentland Firth largest in August; and
only stragglers are seen by 1st October (see letter). No great
movement to date of 1st October of other birds, except the last
two days, 29th and 30th September. Rush shortly at date
expected&mdash;(see schedules). Mr John Gilmour, under date of
5th November, sends wings and feet of a Yellow Bunting.
It was shot on the 2d November. He goes on to say&mdash;"we
had not many birds here during October, as compared with
what I have seen in former years; the wind was never in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">- 5 -</span>
east during the whole month. But the wind having shifted to
S.E. during the first three days of November, with a strong
gale, we have had a considerable 'rush' of Fieldfares, Redwings,
Goldcrests, Song Thrush, Blackbirds, Woodcock, Snow
Bunting, and Yellow Bunting. There is also, with little doubt,
a Hoopoe, described as seen on 9th October." All the lighthouse
keepers at Pentland Skerries assist keenly in the work, during
their watches, <i>viz.</i>, Messrs Mercer (principal), M'Gaw and
Dawson (assistants).</p>

<p><i>Dunnet Head.</i>&mdash;David Laidlaw and James Carson.&mdash;One
schedule.&mdash;"Gulls came to the cliffs to breed a fortnight earlier,
and left a fortnight earlier, about the middle of February to
middle of September." Hawks and Carrion (?) Crows (Hooded?)
frequent the cliffs in the breeding season. Gannets reported
during July, August, and September, passing and repassing in
such quantities, that it would be quite impossible to form any
idea.</p>

<p><i>Noss Head.</i>&mdash;James Ferrier.&mdash;One schedule.&mdash;Note: "The
Cormorants breed here under the headland, and never leave all
winter; go forth to feed early, and return to rest in the
evening." [Query: Is this the real Cormorant, or only the
Shag? I fancy the latter most probably.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>Buchan Ness.</i>&mdash;William Ross.</p>

<p><i>Bell Rock.</i>&mdash;James Jack.&mdash;Unfortunately a spring schedule is
lost. This one dates 1st September to 21st. But the spring
schedule was, Mr Jack says, very light, and few birds seem to
pass this way in spring except Larks.</p>

<p><i>Inchkeith.</i>&mdash;Robert Grierson.&mdash;March 14th to October 16th,
seven entries under seven dates.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Separate Report under Genera and Species.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Thrushes.</i>&mdash;Returns commence in <i>January</i>, and
between 1st and 23d, Blackbirds, Fieldfares, occur in small
numbers, and one Thrush on 23d; wind variable, from fresh S.W.
to strong E. on 7th, rest westerly; all at Pentland Skerries.</p>

<p><i>February.</i>&mdash;A single record of Blackbird at Pentland Skerries
on 24th.</p>

<p><i>March.</i>&mdash;At Pentland Skerries, two dates of straggling Blackbirds,
3d and 14th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">- 6 -</span></p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;Thrushes and Blackbirds at N. Ronaldshay and Pentland
Skerries, 4th, at latter, and between then and 27th; and
Ring Ouzels on 27th, with S.E. fresh on island.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;Most returns from Pentland Skerries of Blackbirds
and Thrushes; winds variable, but with easterly tendency.
Also one record from Noss Head.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;No great appearance; indeed, as compared with
1886, infinitesimal. Only small items on six dates, between
10th and 31st, of Redwings (10th), and Blackbirds, Song
Thrushes (23d), and Fieldfares (31st); winds northerly and
easterly.</p>

<p><i>November.</i>&mdash;The above succeeded by a "perfect rush" of Fieldfares
at same station on the 1st. "Flocks all day;" and also of
Redwings (several) and two Blackbirds. 2d, Song Thrushes all
day. (Winds continuing easterly, but more to south than in
October.) Yet after this no great movement apparently at
Pentland Skerries. Only other stations recording are Dunnet
Head (Fieldfares, strong N.E. breeze, haze; and Noss Head
S.S.E. gale, a few Thrushes); and at N. Ronaldshay, Blackbirds
and Thrushes; strong E.N.E. and showers.</p>

<p><i>December.</i>&mdash;Rush all over; only two records at Pentland
Skerries of Blackbirds on 21st and 26th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>January.</i>&mdash;6th, one "Stonechat" (Wheatear?),
at 1.11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; strong S. at N. Unst.</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;This may not have been a Common Wheatear at such
a date.</p>

<p><i>March.</i>&mdash;At Pentland Skerries one Whinchat all day;
moderately W., and showers "rare."</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;At Pentland Skerries, 6th, Wheatears (<i>sic</i>) all day
on lighthouse; Light N. cloudy; more by the 10th, and one
<i>Redstart</i> (or more?) on 27th.</p>

<p><i>May.</i>&mdash;" Stonechats" (at N. Ronaldshay)&mdash;[probably Wheatears
<i>vera</i>.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] on 17th; and Redstart, male, at Pentland
Skerries all day on 4th.</p>

<p><i>June.</i>&mdash;One only record at N. Unst, at 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on the 6th;
light S. breeze; rested on rock.</p>

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;<i>Blank.</i></p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;At Pentland Skerries, 17th, 19th, and 23d, single
Wheatears: winds various, from light W.N.W.; moderate N. to
fresh S.W. on the three dates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">- 7 -</span></p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;At N. Unst, one on 20th, and single occurrences
on 23d and 30th, same place.</p>

<p>At Pentland Skerries, one Redstart &#9792; on 3d, and Wheatears
again at ditto, on 22d; and at N. Unst, on 26th, single birds.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;"Stonechats," Wheatears, etc., at N. Unst, 26th, and
earlier at more southern stations; earliest at Bell Rock on 1st;
rush on 5th at <i>Fidra</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "numbers on island all day." Stations
returning in small numbers, N. Unst, Pentland Skerries, Bell
Rock, Inchkeith, and Fidra. No more records after October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silviin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Spring.</i>&mdash;<i>March.</i>&mdash;One Redbreast all day on 1st
at Pentland Skerries; fresh W., haze.</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;23d, One Redbreast on lighthouse; S.E., haze.</p>

<p><i>Autumn.</i>&mdash;September.&mdash;At Bell Rock, on 15th, one Robin;
and at Fidra, one on 24th.</p>

<p><i>December.</i>&mdash;At Dunnet Head, one; N., clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phylloscopin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In April.&mdash;On Pentland Skerries, on 23d
and 24th; a few all day; S.E., showers. The only spring
record.</p>

<p><i>Autumn.</i>&mdash;<i>September.</i>&mdash;At N. Unst, one W. Warbler; N.,
strong breeze and showers; and at Noss Head one Goldcrest
all day.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;Nothing; but in November, five or six Goldcrests
all day at Pentland Skerries; S.S.E. and rain.</p>

<p><i>December.</i>&mdash;One Goldcrest cock; N.W. gale at Noss Head;
flying about the outhouses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Blank.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accentorid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>Blank.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;No records till <i>September</i>; and then only
two at Bell Rock (on 24th), and Inchkeith (28th), young birds.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;One Common Wren at N. Unst; N.N.W., clear, on
2d (see W. Nichol's Notes).</p>

<p><i>November.</i>&mdash;At Pentland Skerries, single birds reported; light
N.W. wind ("first seen for some time"), on 11th, 12th; at
Dunnet Head, one; light W. breeze, clear on 29th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>April.</i>&mdash;7th, at Pentland Skerries, the first
seen this spring; light variable, clear. Again single birds seen
on 27th, one of Pied Wagtail and one Rays [? or the long-tailed
yellow one, which is the Grey Wagtail. Rays has very short tail.&mdash;J.
A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;Rays Wagtail is again alluded to, but we suspect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">- 8 -</span>
this will turn out to be the Grey. [Yet Mr Barrington, in June
1886, <i>shot</i> a veritable <i>M. Raii</i> in N. Rona!!]</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;One record of Wagtail at Pentland Skerries, after
strong N.W. wind on island.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;At Pentland Skerries, a few Pied Wagtails, on
five dates between 3d and 22d. The most, six on the 22d;
also one Wagtail at Bell Rock on 2d; strong S. breeze.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;Pied Wagtails at Pentland Skerries, fresh W., on 5th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>January.</i>&mdash;Rock Pipits noted at N. Unst on 29th.
No more of this species till Autumn.</p>

<p><i>March.</i>&mdash;At N. Unst on 7th, and again on 21st, "Mosscheepers,"
and at Bell Rock, a few on 20th and 23d; S.E., fresh,
and haze.</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;A few on 23d at N. Unst; "three or four remained
all the year."</p>

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;Three at N. Unst; S.W., strong breeze. [But are these
not resident?&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

records as usual. Nothing new to be gleaned from them.
Principally Sparrow Hawk (usually meaning <i>Merlins</i>), Falcons,
Kestrel, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelecanid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Cormorants.&mdash;We have not catalogued yet all
the winter colonies of the Great Cormorant, so records of this
species are useful. The only birds recorded this year on E.
Coast are: <i>October</i> 27th, four, flying E. Wind N.W. at Pentland
Skerries. <i>November</i> 21st, flock of thirty, resting on rock of
N. Unst.</p>

<p>We have had a number of schedules entirely devoted to
Gannets at some of the more prominent stations, and these,
with other accounts already published, will at some future date
constitute material for a very thorough treatment of the
movements of the species, and their relations to the migrations
of the Herring.</p>

<p>We therefore omit schedule notes on the Gannet at present.
But lest our reporters think their work thus wasted or lost, we
hasten to undeceive them, for we consider that the movements
of Solan Geese, as held in relation to their known breeding areas,
and the habits and distribution of the Herring (their principal
food, if not indeed almost their <i>only</i> food), is of most particular
economic importance. Much hinges upon it <i>undoubtedly</i>, as
any one who has studied not only its habits, also the great
question of our sea-fisheries, is bound to know, or he has
missed the whole importance of the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardeid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Herons are ubiquitous, even in the "Remoter
Isles," and even where they do not breed. Their regular occurrence
along and over all our coasts, at <i>all</i> seasons, and independent
of breeding stations, makes statistics of a value difficult
to ascertain. But one thing seems quite certain, their migrations,
local movements, curious presence at all points, and at
all times, is <i>not</i> dependent upon the movements of <i>deep-sea</i>
fishes. The Heron's food-supplies are of a much more cosmopolitan
nature, and he finds that which he requires to keep him
at all seasons, in all weathers, at all tides; and his long neck
and legs must be of considerable service to him in all these
varying circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Report.</i>&mdash;<i>March.</i>&mdash;7th, one Heron (N.W., clear) on lighthouse of
Pentland Skerries.</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;Not a record anywhere.</p>

<p><i>May.</i>&mdash;Two Herons at Pentland Skerries on 17th flying about
lighthouse. [Were they <i>old or young?</i>]</p>

<p><i>June.</i>&mdash;<i>Blank.</i></p>

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;Scarcely more so. "Three Herons, on the 4th of July,
circled around the rocks of Pentland Skerries about 3.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;the
wind light S.&mdash;and flew away again to the west."</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;At the same place (which either has special
attractions, or specially careful recorders&mdash;we incline to the
latter), on the 26th, two Herons "sat upon the island;" S.E.
haze.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;Five Herons&mdash;again at the same place&mdash;appeared;
and three on the 24th.</p>

the 2d, after encountering a fresh N. wind and cloudy sky.</p>

<p><i>November.</i>&mdash;One Heron, at 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, was seen at the same
favoured isle, but flying <i>north</i> over the island; wind light N.W.,

N. Unst in their burrows there, and may be said never to be
absent from the neighbourhood.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.] There seems to
have been, however, unusually large movements of the Petrels,

<p><i>December.</i>&mdash;Only three entries&mdash;10th, 12th, and 16th, at
Pentland Skerries and at <i>Dunnet</i>. Three birds.</p>

<p>Snipe, equally scarce with the last. One entry in March,
and none again till 3d of November, and no more afterwards.</p>

<p>Curlew has many entries, yet not so many as in 1886; but
the Curlew can only be considered as a very partial migrant,
and entries are mostly of local interest only.</p>

<p>We do not repeat the comparative tables given under Curlew,
Woodcock, Snipe, and Jacksnipe, which we gave in 1886

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Summary and General Remarks.</span></p>

<p>In January depressions of very considerable size passed by our
north-western and northern shores after the 2d, with very sudden
changes of temperature of an unusual character and great
magnitude; showers of cold rain, sleet, and hail from day to
day, and very severe frosts at night. There are very clear indications
in the diary of Migration, that the atmospheric disturbances
were concurrent with a great rush of birds going south
along the coast. Those chiefly noted being Fieldfares, Blackbirds,
Thrushes, Redwings, Larks, Chaffinches, Linnets, Starlings,
and some Crows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">- 56 -</span></p>

<p>In the latter part of February and throughout March there
are indications of the passage of Crows, Rooks, Daws, Starlings,
Larks, and others to the Continent, also in the opposite direction
to the S.E. Coast of England. Great numbers of Starlings,
Thrashes, and Larks were also observed at the lanterns at night,
the particular direction of their flight being not apparent.</p>

<p>A Blackcap (<i>Sylvia atricapilla</i>) is recorded at the Cockle <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>
on March 31st, after which the first actual indication of the
Spring migration is the occurrence of. Swifts (<i>Cypselus apus</i>) at
the Spurn on April 5th, arriving at 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and resting on the
window sills all night; on the same day at Great Cotes several
male Wheatears were seen. The Spring migration of the
Wheatear (<i>Saxicola &aelig;nanthe</i>) is last recorded at the Farn <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>
on the night of May 30th, several round the lantern; and at
the Tees <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> on June 5th, two to N.W.</p>

<p>Puffins (<i>Fratercula arctica</i>) arrived at their breeding quarters
on the Farn Islands on March 30th, a very early date. Continuous
flocks with Wild Ducks were seen at the Outer Dowsing <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> on
April 12th, going S.S.E.; at the same date a Woodcock was
killed at the Swin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> The Swallow (<i>Hirundo rustica</i>) is first
seen at the Galloper <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> on April 11th, going N.W. Many at
the Hanois <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Guernsey, on the same day, with Willow Wrens
and Whitethroats. At the Shipwash <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, Swallows were
observed at intervals passing from S.E. to N.W. up to June
4th.</p>

<p>Snow Buntings (<i>Plectrophanes nivalis</i>) were last seen at the
Spurn on April 20th. The Cuckoo is first recorded at the Isle
of Thanet on April 24th, and the Yellow Wagtail (<i>Motacilla
raii</i>) on the 25th.</p>

<p>There appears to have been a heavy rush of the smaller
summer visitants on the S.E. coast, from the Isle of Thanet to
Hunstanton, at early morning of the 29th of April. A very
strongly pronounced movement was also observed at Hanois
<span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span>, Guernsey, on May 2d. The weather, in the first instance,
being rainy and unsettled in S.E., and very cold over England
with N.E. winds. On the 30th, thunderstorm in S.W. of France,
with very cold, unsettled, and rainy weather generally in the
south.</p>

<p>Various shorebirds and waders were observed passing down
the coast from S. to N., on May 12th and subsequently.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">- 57 -</span>
A Moorhen (<i>Gallinula chloropus</i>) was killed at the Cockle
<span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> on the night of May 21st; another at the Goodwin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> on
the night of October 16th.</p>

<p>A Bearded Reedling (<i>Panurus biarmicus</i>) was seen at the
Languard <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> on February 16th at 7.40 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; and from Yarmouth
on November 13th is the note, "nice lot of Bearded
Tits, are said to have come in at a great height, and from
the E."</p>

<p>The autumn movement commenced early in July, but did
not become very distinctly pronounced before the beginning of
August. One of the most interesting features of the autumnal
migration has been the simultaneous occurrences of the Pygmy
Curlew (<i>Tringa subarquata</i>) and the Little Stint (<i>Tringa minuta</i>)
on the East Coast, between the Tees and Yarmouth. The
former species is first recorded from Redcar on August 16th
and from the Spurn on August the 23d. The Little Stint in
the same locality on the 25th. Both were present there in
very large numbers on September 2d, with a S.W. gale. The
Pygmy Curlew was seen last on the Norfolk coast on October
8th, and one, Farn Islands, on November 18th.</p>

<p>The Woodcock is first recorded at Seaton-Carew, Durham, on
September 19th, and at Cromer <span class="allsmcap">L.H.</span> on September 25th, from
12.30 to 2.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> (S.E., 4.) Our observer, Mr Comben, says,
"never saw so many Woodcock at one time before, there
seemed to be a constant stream flying round lantern, none
struck." Woodcocks appear to have come in at irregular
intervals between September 30th and November 3d. The
greatest number perhaps on the 9th, 10th, and 11th of October.
Throughout September there was a steady and almost daily
increasing migration observed at East Coast stations, but from
the 29th and throughout October to November 3d, there was
an almost continuous night and day rush of immigrants, the
chief of those recorded being Crows, Rooks, Daws, Starlings,
Larks, Chaffinches, Linnets, and Sparrows. In fact, during this
time much the greater proportion of the entries in the schedules
consists of a weary reiteration of these readily distinguished
species. The weather during the period of this great invasion
was up to the 25th of October mainly anticyclonic, cold, quiet,
and dry. The prevailing wind N. and N.-easterly. After the
25th, cyclonic with W. and S.-westerly winds, wet, rough, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">- 58 -</span>
milder. The average temperature of the month was much
colder than the corresponding months in the two preceding years.
It does not appear that the change of weather and of the wind
after the 25th, had any influence on the migratory movements,
birds continuing to pour in with undiminished numbers. Indeed,
the direction and force of the wind appears to have little
to do in controlling these great autumnal rushes, for when
the time for crossing the North Sea has come, birds cross
independent of weather. It must be admitted, however, that
the prevailing wind at the time is an important factor in
governing the direction in which migrants travel, and the angle
at which the line of flight will intersect the line of coast. To
changes of temperature either sudden or gradual, rather than
the force and direction of winds, we must probably look for the
impelling cause of these seasonal phenomena.</p>

<p>After the 3d and to the 19th of November, birds continued
to arrive, but in greatly reduced numbers, the throbs and pulsations
of the great inrush becoming daily more feeble and less
sustained. After this date to the end of the year, migration was
more or less spasmodic, the entries in the schedules being chiefly
confined to the occurrences of various birds seen in the vicinity
of the stations.</p>

<p>Swans and Grey Geese have been remarkably scarce. Brent
Geese (<i>Bernicla brenta</i>) fairly numerous. All accounts agree
that it has been an extraordinary Duck year, large numbers of
various species frequenting all favourable localities along the
East Coast. The Common Scoter (<i>&#338;demia nigra</i>) has occurred
in enormous flocks, also a few <i>&#338;. fusca</i>. Considerable numbers
of the Long-Tailed Duck (<i>Harelda glacialis</i>) have visited the
coast from the Farn Islands to Yarmouth.</p>

<p>Amongst the rarer and more interesting species we may
notice the occurrences of <i>Tringa temmincki</i> (three) at the Spurn,
also <i>Podiceps nigricollis</i> at the same place. <i>Anthus richardi</i> at
Tetney. <i>Cypselus melba</i>, <i>Recurvirostra avocetta</i>, and <i>Tringa
maculata</i> at Yarmouth, also <i>Pandion halia&euml;tus</i> at the Cromer
lighthouse.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that we do not know more about those
smaller night wanderers which are usually entered in our
schedules under the general name "Flycatchers" or "various
small birds." The wings occasionally forwarded are always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">- 59 -</span>
very interesting, and, what is most important, give definite and
reliable results. As a rule all these small insect-eating species
get lumped together as "Flycatchers," a result not to be wondered
at considering the circumstances under which they are
seen, helplessly fluttering against the lanterns, or dancing like
gnats in the yellow glare. Those "hundreds of Flycatchers,"
from midnight to 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, seen at the Swin <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span> on the night of
April 29th, no doubt represented many species of our small
summer visitors, and the Spotted Flycatcher (<i>Muscicapa grisola</i>)
was not seen in the Isle of Thanet before May 4th.</p>

<p>In the same way as we treated of the East Coast returns, we
treat the West Coast. The contents of one or two schedules
written across the columns have been omitted for reasons before
stated, more especially as none of these are of great importance.</p>

<p class="caption4nb"><i>Diary from the Stations.</i></p>

<p><i>Butt of Lewis.</i>&mdash;Mr Robert Agnew, son of Mr Joseph Agnew
(now at Monach Isles), sends three well-filled schedules, one
being devoted, as requested, to Solan Geese after the date of
September 4th.</p>

<p><i>Monach Isles.</i>&mdash;Mr Joseph Agnew (late of Isle of May) sends
eight schedules, one for Solan Geese. Mr Agnew says, "The
Merganser is by far the most abundant of the ducks....
All Curlews come from the N. East, not one coming from the
south (August). After coming so far, they turn inland; and,
I have no doubt, the old are leading the young to previously
well-known feeding grounds." "Geese seen flying S.E., as if
from St Kilda" (August 17th). Statement that "one pair, at
least, of Turnstones bred at Monach this year requires confirmation"
(20th August). "Terns flying S.W., remarked as unusual"
(30th). "I feel the place lonely to-day without the
Terns. They must have <i>seen</i> their friends passing yesterday,
and have gone off in pursuit" (31st August). "Sandpipers of
sorts numerous by 1st September." "From 50 to 100 Cormorants
on a rock remain fishing." October 22d: "I have never
seen such a rush of Redwings alone without any admixture.
They commenced to come about 7 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> <i>last night</i>, and continued
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">- 62 -</span>
to 'strike' till 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; but many remained at the lantern till
daylight. They were mostly all fine old birds. Most of those
killed were on the N.E. side, so they must have been flying
dead against the wind, which was blowing strong from the
S.W." ... "It appears a S.W. wind here is best for migration."
"Greenfinches and Bramblings noted on 27th, with a
gale from the S.W. Very heavy migration."</p>

<p>Mr Agnew's letter of the 7th November 1887 is well worthy
of careful perusal, but is too long for insertion here;<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but the
following short extracts, or digest, may be acceptable:&mdash;"The
surprises I have met with during the last month beat all previous
ones (as shown in the schedule to date). One of the few
Goldcrests taken in the Long Island was found dead amongst
other species."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> The materials have been utilised for a forthcoming work on the "Vertebrate
Fauna of the Outer Hebrides."</p>

</div>

<p>On November 4th Mr Agnew reports the rushes of migrants
as "very extraordinary." "That of yesterday larger than that
of 1st," and in moonlight and clear. The advanced guard were
Starlings from N.E., flying down the coast line, with wind "on
the port bow." [<i>Note.</i>&mdash;Mr Agnew's notes are so voluminous
and so interesting, that I hope some way may be found to
utilise them more fully. Many letters deserve a better fate
than oblivion. A great variety of species participated in this
rush, including Woodcock.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>Barra Head.</i>&mdash;Mr Chas. M'Fadzen sends two carefully filled
schedules, in which the Geese referred to are mostly Barnacle.</p>

<p><i>Rona.</i>&mdash;Messrs D. Dunnet and J. A. M'Gaw send one filled
schedule, from February 15th to November 12th, with the
further note: "Migration of birds here fewer in numbers than
former years. Solan Geese all summer as usual."</p>

<p><i>Kyleakin.</i>&mdash;Messrs D. MacCulloch and John Clyne send
three well-filled schedules. Rush noticeable early in November,
but greater rush 10th December of Larks and Linnets, yet not
one seen near the lanterns.</p>

<p><i>Skerryvore.</i>&mdash;Mr Thomas Dawson sends four good schedules&mdash;two
on Solan Geese. Under date of 1st October, he says,
whilst having little of importance to relate, that he witnessed
a remarkable tussle between three Gannets and a large fish,
two coming to help the first, which had remained a long time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">- 63 -</span>
under water after striking, whilst no doubt struggling with
its prey.</p>

<p><i>Dhuheartach.</i>&mdash;Messrs Wm. Davidson and J. W. M'Guffie send
four good schedules. The Siskin occurred on the 10th November,
and was sent for identification, having been caught on the
lantern. "Heavy rush" all night of 11th.</p>

<p><i>Skervuile.</i>&mdash;Mr John Ewing sends three filled schedules down
to November 21st, after which no more migration was observed.
Harvie-Brown visited Skervuile and landed on the whales-back-looking
rock on which the lighthouse is founded, and
which is awash with the sea.</p>

<p><i>Rhinns of Islay.</i>&mdash;Messrs Peter Anderson and James Ducat
send nine carefully filled sheets, and write nearly each time at
length. At the same time we are now, thanks to these reporters,
obliged for a much more minute, and day-to-day return for each
month of the year, most carefully prepared under species and in
tabular form, which cannot fail to prove interesting and useful
to work from. These date December 1886 to February 1888.
The Rhinns of Islay must be looked upon as quite one of the
most important West Coast stations for migration.</p>

<p>A Manx Shearwater is reported as caught on the lantern on
the 20th April, and another was seen next morning. They are
the first of the kind the keepers ever remember seeing. The
occurrence thus makes it appear that Manx Shearwaters probably
pair early, if they do not pair for life.</p>

<p>On August 2d, clouds of Midges round the lantern; and on
13th, from twenty to thirty Daddy-longlegs were captured.
This season the very worst for Caterpillars (or "Kail-worm").
Glass rarely below 60&deg; on the N. side at midnight, and again as
warm on 10th September. [<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The warm weather about
this time was universal.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>"The only rush we have had has been of Larks, and they
have been in greater numbers than any year since I came here.
One solitary Redwing is all I have seen this year. We have
had such a long time of N. and N.W. winds. Best winds are
S. to S.E. to bring the most birds. On October 9th, 1000's of
Puffins appeared "flying North;" Iceland Gull on 10th; six
Choughs seen on island on 16th, no doubt local birds. Heavy
returns from October 19th onwards to 25th, of Larks and Starlings.
Local visitation of Rooks owing to shooting going on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">- 64 -</span>
through the island, and their leaving the rookeries at Bridgend,
etc.; also Jackdaws. No great migration recorded in November
of small land birds. (Compare with Monach Isles returns.)
Iceland Gull seen at head of Lochindaul on the 9th of February
1888 (<i>in lit.</i> 15th February 1888.)</p>

<p><i>Lochindaul: Islay.</i>&mdash;Mr James Edgar sends eight carefully
filled and interesting schedules. Reports a Shearwater at the
lantern on 21st April; it rested all night. [No doubt the same
bird seen the day before at Rhinns of Islay along with the one
which was killed. This is interesting, as showing a line of
flight and the certainty bright lights have of luring birds to
them.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>Lamlash.</i>&mdash;Unsigned: one small return of five entries, between
March 10th and September 17th, of Curlews, Thrush. Cuckoo
heard. 25th April, Snipe and Geese.</p>

<p><i>Ailsa Craig.</i>&mdash;Our first returns sent from the "Old Rock"
are very full in interest, and date January 9th, 1887, to December
20th, occupying three schedules, by Mr William J. Dawson.
"An Eagle seen on the hill on 19th October and previously;
'very large,' and probably a Sea-Eagle. Remained for more
than three weeks. On 20th December a Carrier Pigeon was
chased into the yard by two Peregrine Falcons (a pair build on
the cliffs every season). They captured it next day. On the 20th
January 1888, another Carrier was seen with a paper attached
to it, and the Falcons were in pursuit of it. Most likely it
shared the same fate as the other." [If any one can throw
further light on this rather interesting note, we would be
obliged. It serves, at least, to show one danger which Carriers
may be subjected to.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p>"Very few birds come near this light, the lantern revolving
so rapidly. When I was at Pladda there were great rushes of
birds at different times both in spring and autumn, and large
numbers were found dead." [Our Committee has never received
<i>a single return from Pladda</i>. This chance note may yet be
valuable.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>Corsewall.</i>&mdash;Mr Robert Laidlaw sends one well-filled schedule,
and notices the rushes of Blackbirds and <i>Turdid&aelig;</i> in
October, and of the same and <i>Fringillid&aelig;</i> (Linnets, etc.) in
November.</p>

<p><i>Mull of Galloway.</i>&mdash;Messrs Alexander Murray and John
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">- 65 -</span>
M'Quarrie send one schedule, also well filled, to date of September 17th.</p>

<p><i>Little Ross.</i>&mdash;Messrs Neil M'Donald and Robert Macintosh
send four good schedules. Petrel found dead at foot of tower,
23d January. Spring migration considerable, but decidedly
scarce on the autumn migration, as compared with some other
West Coast stations.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelecanid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Of Gannets, by request, we have had a number
of schedules entirely devoted to them at some of the
more prominent stations of both East and West Coasts; but as
these, with other accounts already published, constitute material
for a very thorough treatment of the movements of the species,
and their relations to the migrations of the Herring, we do not
think it advisable in this place to occupy space with them.</p>


<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Separate Report under Genera and Species.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turdid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Appears to have been the most numerous migrants
in 1887.</p>

<p><i>January.</i>&mdash;A rush marked at Ailsa (1886 Report, <i>q.v.</i>), and a
few singles.</p>

<p><i>February.</i>&mdash;Skervuile, 15th to 21st, "Blackbirds and
Thrushes." Turnberry, "many do. on 25th." At Little Ross,
fewer, on 16th and 17th.</p>

<p><i>March.</i>&mdash;Stations are: Skerryvore (one), and Dhuheartach
(one). Rhinns of Islay, a few records of Blackbirds, Thrushes,
and Redwings. "Rush" at Ailsa Craig on 11th; strong
N.E. breeze, snow. Little Ross, scattered records between 1st
and 26th of Thrushes and Blackbirds.</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;Only record is of two Fieldfares at Little Ross on
20th. Nothing in May to <i>September</i>&mdash;intermittent of Thrushes,
only four dates at four places, <i>viz.</i>, Barra Head, Kyleakin,
Dhuheartach, and Corsewall.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;Numbers travelling, yet not so very densely. Rush
of Thrushes on 16th at Corsewall. Great numbers of Redwing
at Butt of Lewis, 21st and 22d; and one Fieldfare on 30th
there. Other stations: Dhuheartach, Rhinns of Islay (Redwings),
Lochindaul, Corsewall, and Little Ross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">- 66 -</span></p>

<p><i>November.</i>&mdash;At Monach Isles surprising numbers of Fieldfares
and Redwings, rushing between 1st and 12th; great
numbers of Redwings (see Diary); also on 1st, 10th, 11th (many
Fieldfares). Large numbers Mavis on 11th; also Blackbirds,
scarcer. Rush felt most elsewhere at Skerryvore and Dhuheartach,
also on 11th; strong N.E. breeze!! all night. Many
killed at both these places. Lighter at Skervuile (Missel
Thrushes also), Fieldfares and Redwings; and at Lochindaul,
4th to 9th to 20th, and Corsewall (generally full and large), but
concentrated most at Monach, Skerryvore, and Dhuheartach.
Continued lightly into December at same stations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saxicolin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>February.</i>&mdash;8th, one "Stonechat" at Little
Ross.</p>

<p><i>March.</i>&mdash;1st, one Whinchat at Dhuheartach. 4th, one "Stonechat"
at Rhinns of Islay. [These "Stonechats," "Whinchats,"
and "Wheatears" must, we fear, be hopelessly mixed always,
as the correspondence now, to fix it, would entail enormous
labour.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;12th, Wheatear at Butt of Lewis; and 6th, ditto at
Corran Ferry; and 13th and 20th, a few ditto at same place.
Whinchat at Dhuheartach on 15th, and Wheatear on 17th.

numbers); and Little Ross, 7th (a number), and 11th; winds
variable, S.E. and S. to N., rarely W. or N.W.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;Few, and all left Monach Isles by the 9th; but
"many" again there. "Many" on the 22d ("continued on").
At Butt of Lewis also one seen on 21st. At Skerryvore, 3d,
4th, 21st ("Stonechats" in distinction to Wheatears); 26th,
ditto; and 25th, Redstart; and at Dhuheartach, 26th, Wheatears;

restricted migration. One obtained at Monach (rare).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acrocephalin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>September.</i>&mdash;3d, one Sedge Warbler at Little
Ross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Troglodytid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Wren.&mdash;One on April 5th at Ailsa; one at

<p><span class="smcap">Motacillid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>March.</i>&mdash;15th, at Monach, a Grey Wagtail
[we suspect the Pied is meant, as the true <i>Grey</i> is really yellow

Lochindaul.</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;23d, at Butt of Lewis. Scattered records, few and
far between, at Skerryvore, of "Grey Wagtails" (?); and of
other Wagtails at Lochindaul; and one at Little Ross on

<p><i>November.</i>&mdash;Large numbers, in flocks and parties, of Greenfinches.
2d to 28th&mdash;a <i>great rush</i> in comparison with other
places.</p>

<p><i>December.</i>&mdash;Continuing in numbers all month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emberizid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;<i>March.</i>&mdash;Snow Buntings at Butt of Lewis from

Scarcely any migration seen after November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alaudid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Trifling in January and March; September,
large flocks at Monach on 23d; April (Monach). Numbers in

local flights.&mdash;J. A. H.-B.]; a few in March, early leading up.
A great rush daily by 28th, at Rhinns of Islay; 11th, at Ailsa
(rush); 31st, at Lochindaul, daily. Few after.</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;Few.</p>

(one), September (two), October (one Barn Owl at Rhinns of
Islay), November (three Barn Owls at Rhinns of Islay at lantern).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accipitin&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Numbers of records of Hawks on predatory
quests (Merlin, Sparrow, Kestrel, Falcon) at almost all times
when other birds are there, bulking, of course, at the height of
the migratory season, especially of the Waders and Sandpipers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pelecanid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Special schedules for Gannets, and the whole
Gannet migration will be undertaken later.</p>

<p>Again in <i>May</i>, Merganser Ducks at Monach&mdash;came on 28th,
left on 30th. Eider continued to be seen during May in flocks
here and there, and fewer in June.</p>

October, and November. Consisted of the following species
recorded:&mdash;"Wild Geese," Eiders, Wild Ducks, Mergansers
(Monach), Barnacle Geese (Barra Head), Teal Duck? (Barra

abundant, and a few Wild Duck); Rona (Eiders); Kyleakin
(Wild Geese); Barra Head (Barnacle Geese, Teal Duck?);
Skerryvore (Barnacle Geese, Eiders); Dhuheartach (do. do.);
Rhinns of Islay (Wild Geese, Eiders abundantly, and Ducks of
sorts); Lochindaul, etc., etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charadriid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Oyster-Catchers; nothing new. Golden
Plovers, no great autumn movement. Few other records at all
of Lapwings, Ring Dotterels. A sort of rush of Lapwings in
August, 1st to 24th; at Lochindaul, greatest on 14th, but flocks
for days before. A few seen at Ailsa Craig, and one only at
Mull of Galloway.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;Few records at all.</p>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;Lapwings entirely at Rhinns of Islay, and in November
the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scolopacid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Curlews universal; nothing new. Other
species mentioned all through the year. <i>Whimbrel</i> at Rhinns
of Islay (May), forty in a flock; rested. <i>Jack Snipe?</i> at Butt
of Lewis, 25th August. Snipe: Woodcock (in November), 12th
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">- 72 -</span>
only; at Rona, Skye, and at Dhuheartach same date. (Scarce
this season, at least, as seen on migration.) Most of the records
here apply, and bulk with Curlew. Sandpipers, Redshanks,
Dunlins at several stations also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturnin&aelig;</span> and <span class="smcap">Larid&aelig;</span>.&mdash;Nothing of much fresh interest
Besides commoner species, the following are noticed:&mdash;Boatswain
Birds (15th August, at Skervuile); Skuas and "Dirty
Aliens," "Small Gulls" (at Skervuile, 17th July); Iceland
Gulls (Rhinns of Islay), etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcid&aelig;, Colymbid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;Unusually abundant in Autumn at
most stations, but do not warrant special remark here.</p>

<p class="caption3nb"><span class="smcap">Summary of Observations.</span></p>

<p><i>January.</i>&mdash;On several occasions during the month a few
Thrushes, Fieldfares, Blackbirds, Larks, Starlings, and Curlews
were observed at the lanterns, but all the movements recorded
appear to be purely local in their nature.</p>

<p><i>February.</i>&mdash;The same species are occasionally and locally
noted as in January; but on the 17th, Wheatears were noted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">- 77 -</span>
at the Chickens Rock lantern, and a Ring Ouzel was shot at St
Tudwal's&mdash;these harbingers of spring making their appearance
with the south-westerly winds and mild weather which then
spread over our islands.</p>

<p><i>March.</i>&mdash;The month commenced with a spell of anticyclonic
weather&mdash;cold, gloomy, and foggy over England during the
daytime, but with sharp frosts at night. The effect of this
weather led to a renewal of the local movements of the Turdid&aelig;,
Chaffinches, Larks, Starlings, Lapwings, etc. Shallow local
disturbances followed, and on the 15th, which was a most
miserable and unsettled day all over England, there was a very
great rush of birds at the Nash, flying before very heavy snow,
from 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Mr Nicholas says, "two or three
hundred birds could be seen at a time," and that he recognised
Skylarks, Starlings, Snipe, Woodcocks, Lapwings, Golden
Plovers, Mallard, Teal, and many other birds flying in the
snow. Anticyclones followed, prevailing until the 20th, producing
a good deal of fog and severe frosts. The frost caused
some of the lanterns to be visited by the usual gipsy species,
but, among others, a "Woodcock, eight Pied Wagtails, and a
Kingfisher were killed. Unsettled weather followed. On the
29th an anticyclone advanced completely over the British
Islands, and with it fair, dry, quiet weather prevailed until the
end of the month. On the 29th, amongst other species, scores
of Wheatears fluttered around the Eddystone light; on the
30th, Razorbills and Puffins put in an appearance at their
summer haunts on the Calf of Man; and Puffins arrived at St
Tudwal's on the 31st.</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;The month commenced with cold winds and showers
of snow and sleet. After the 5th the disturbing conditions passed
away, and on the 7th fine bright sunny weather was established,
though the temperature remained low. On the 10th, Ring
Ouzels and Wheatears were recorded, and the first Swallows
appeared at four stations between Devon and the Isle of Man
on the 11th. On the 17th the fine weather broke, and changeable,
unsettled conditions prevailed over the country generally.
During this period Ring Ouzels, Wheatears, and Willow and
other Warblers were observed at the Eddystone, and a few
Swallows at various stations. Towards the end of the month
fine weather again prevailed, and on the 30th a Cuckoo was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">- 78 -</span>
beard at St Bees, and numbers of Whinchats and Redstarts
were captured at the lantern of the Shambles light-vessel.</p>

<p><i>May.</i>&mdash;On the 3d the depression which prevailed during the
earliest days of the month passed away, and variable breezes,
with fair weather in some places and local showers in others,
prevailed until the 5th. On the 3d and 4th, extraordinary
rushes of summer immigrants occurred at the Eddystone and
Nash stations (and at Helwick on the 4th), when Wheatears,
Whitethroats, Sedge Warblers, Willow Wrens, Wood Warblers,
Blackcaps, Reed Warblers, Redstarts, Pied Flycatchers, and
Swallows were killed&mdash;some in considerable numbers&mdash;at the
lanterns. On the 16th and 18th, in varying weather, there
were arrivals of summer and transient birds at the S.W. stations.
Conditions afterwards were most unsettled until the 24th, the
weather being wretchedly cold and rough. The only bird recorded
during this period was the Swift&mdash;a species associated in some
districts in England with such unsettled meteorological conditions.
On the 25th a high-pressure system appeared, with
northerly and easterly winds, though dull and cold for the time
of the year. From this date to the end of the month there were
continuous arrivals of summer birds, and many Sandpipers and
Plovers passed the Eddystone on their way to the far north.</p>

<p><i>June.</i>&mdash;The returns for this month are quite unimportant.</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;The first movement from the breeding habitats was
recorded for the 4th, when Curlews were noted at Menai, the
Scarweather <span class="allsmcap">L.V.</span>, and at Bideford Bar. On the 11th, Whimbrel
arrived, and, along with Willow Warblers, Sedge Warblers, and
Whitethroats, struck against the Nash lantern. The weather
entirely broke up on the 15th, and thunderstorms began to
prevail. The 19th and 20th were very cold, and at night slight
ground frosts occurred in several localities. During this spell
of rough weather a number of summer birds were recorded as
emigrating&mdash;Swifts, Swallows, Martins, Warblers, Flycatchers,
and Land Rails. The weather then mended, and became fine
and hot, and little migration appears to be recorded for the
latter days of the month.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;The month commenced with a period of very
rough weather, south-westerly and westerly gales blowing with
great force in the Channel and on our South-West Coasts. On
the passing, away of this severe disturbance, a series of smaller
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">- 79 -</span>
ones followed, and continued with little interruption until the
middle of the month. The returns up to the 17th show an
almost complete dearth of bird-movements during this interval.
On the 17th an anticyclonic spell commenced, which lasted,
without intermission, till the 25th, and concomitant with it
were general migratory movements, full particulars of which
are furnished in the Diary section of this report. A cyclonic
distribution succeeded, during which the weather was on the
whole fair and dry&mdash;foggy at times, and cold for the time of the
year&mdash;and but little migration was noted.</p>

<p><i>October</i> commenced with an anticyclonic stage&mdash;cold, dry, and
fine, with westerly breezes in the north, easterly ones in the
south. This lasted until the 9th, and during its prevalence not
unimportant movements occurred from the 5th to the 9th, when
Larks, Thrushes, Ring Ouzels, Finches, Warblers of several
species, Swallows, and Gold crests appeared at the lanterns.
After the 9th a period of very unsettled cyclonic weather ensued;
the wind became northerly and increased in force, and
showers of snow, sleet, or cold rain continued to fall over the
United Kingdom; and cold and unsettled weather continued
with us until nearly the middle of the month, with no migration.
On the 15th the depression had disappeared, being replaced
by an anticyclonic stage lasting until the 22d. During this
favourable interval there were important and general immigrations
and transient movements of winter birds. There followed
a decided alteration in the stability of the meteorological
conditions over the British Islands and their neighbourhood.
Various systems appeared of a transitory nature, and the changes
of wind and weather were consequently both sudden and frequent.
The movements of birds recorded in our Diary for this
changeable period which witnessed the close of the month were
neither many nor important.</p>

<p><i>November.</i>&mdash;The month commenced with a spell of exceedingly
changeable, unsettled weather, which lasted uninterruptedly
until about the 8th. During this period the only movement
worthy of mention was the not unimportant one recorded for
the S.W. stations on the 7th. On the afternoon of the 11th an
anticyclonic period commenced, and prevailed, with little break,
until the 17th. There were important general movements
on the 11th (on which date a great many&mdash;<i>Saxicola isabellina</i>&mdash;was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">- 80 -</span>
obtained at Allonby in Cumberland), 13th, 14th, with
interesting observations on the 17th and 18th, at S.W.
stations.</p>

<p>There were no other movements of importance up to the close
of the year.</p>

<p>The Report for 1887 on the Irish coast is satisfactory. The
schedules number seventy-five, from thirty-one stations. As a
rule they never were better or more carefully filled, and the
number of legs and wings and specimens is almost 150. In
addition to the schedules, many letters have been received,
either inquiring the names of species or remarking on the special
movements of birds. This shows that the Irish light-keepers
display an intelligent and increasing interest in birds, and are
quite as anxious and as willing as their English and Scottish
brethren to further the objects of this inquiry. It is a difficult
task to select from so many observers any special names; but
the schedules from the Fastnet, Tuskar, and Coningbeg Light-ship,
and the number of specimens accompanying them, deserve
to be gratefully recorded. Messrs George Dunleavy, Patrick
Cullen, W. Clydesdale, Peter Page, Edward M'Kenna, J.
M. Leary, and P. Corish were the contributors. Some light-keepers
are more fortunately situated than others, and the
excellence of a schedule is to some extent dependent on locality.
At the same time at a bad station a watchful observer can
often supply notes which enable us to comprehend more
clearly the range over which the movements of certain species
extend.</p>

<p>At all times it has been a matter for regret that the identification
of birds by the light-keepers was not more accurate. Even
trained ornithologists might readily err in distinguishing species
flying past or around the lanterns, and it cannot be too strongly
impressed on the light-keepers that <i>it is of vital importance to
send a leg and wing of at least one specimen of every species
killed striking. Uncommon birds should be forwarded in the
flesh</i>.</p>

<p>As to rarities, 1887 stands ahead of any other year on the
Irish coast. Two birds have been added to the Irish list&mdash;the
Red-breasted Flycatcher (Mr Alfred B. Wall and Patrick
Clancy), and the Lapland Bunting (Mr George Dunleavy). Both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">- 113 -</span>
were fortunately sent in the flesh&mdash;the former as a "small bird,"
the latter as a "Twite." Particulars of the occurrence of each
is given in the body of the Report. The Greenland Falcon was
received from the Skelligs (Messrs James Walsh and Benjamin
Jeffers)&mdash;shot while eating a rabbit, September 28th. It has
not been noticed on the west coast by the light-keepers since
the winter of 1883-4. Probably <i>Falco candicans</i> loses its way
migrating, or in following the numerous flocks of sea-fowl on
their southerly journey from the arctic seas in the autumn.
The Falcon sent from the Skelligs was a magnificent old male&mdash;legs
yellow, and plumage unusually white. The Pied Flycatcher
is reported to have been seen at the Fastnet on April
12th. Mr George Dunleavy says it was the same species as he
sent the leg and wing of in October 1886. The first Irish
specimen was killed April 18th, 1875, at Ballina (<i>Zoologist</i>,
1875, p. 4498), but other Irish records (see Report for 1886, p.
128) are autumnal.</p>

<p>A Redstart was received from the Fastnet, and the stations
from which the Black Redstart is reported are more numerous
than any year so far; these are authenticated by six specimens
received. The stations extend from Arklow S. light-ship round
the S. coast to Blackrock, Mayo. From the latter station no
specimen was received, but the description in the schedule
agrees with the Black Redstart. None have yet been observed
at any light stations on the N. coast.</p>

<p>The Sedge Warbler is killed striking more frequently than
any other Warbler; next comes the Whitethroat; but at the
N. and N.W. stations no Warblers strike&mdash;the S. and S.E.
coasts containing all the records. The legs and wings doubtfully
referred to the Reed Warbler last year have been re-examined,
and do not belong to that species. A Woodlark was
received in the flesh, shot on the Tearaght Rock by Mr Ryan
on October 20th, one of the last places in Ireland one would
expect to meet this bird, even when migrating. This Lark has
been seen so seldom in Ireland since <i>Thompson's Natural
History</i> was published, in which it is described as a "<i>resident</i>
but very local species," that some questioned its right to be
inserted in the Irish list, especially as no specimens were
produced. It has not been known to breed in Ireland. The
Snow Bunting, as is usual, occurs mainly on the N. and W.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">- 114 -</span>
coasts. In Ireland it is very rare inland, especially in the
southern half.</p>

<p>The Lapland Bunting has already been referred to. It was
found dead October 16th on the Fastnet Rock, and was forwarded
in the flesh. It is a female, and probably of European
origin, and is the first Irish record.</p>

<p>"Mountain Finches" were reported from the Skelligs in
November 1886; but, with this exception, no Bramblings were
mentioned in the schedules until 1887, and the Siskin appears
for the first time, both species being authenticated by specimens.
The distribution of some volumes of Morris' "British Birds" has
probably assisted in their identification, combined with information
received in reply to parcels of legs and wings forwarded.
Yet there can be no doubt 1887 was remarkable for the number
of Bramblings and Siskins which visited Ireland. The data
from light stations is too scanty to speak positively; but, unlike
the Snow Bunting, the Brambling and Siskin seem to have no
preference for the N. and N.W. coasts. "Linnets" is a term
which has appeared in reports from the commencement. It
occasionally includes, there is little doubt, other birds besides
the Grey Linnet. Not a single leg or wing of the Grey Linnet
has yet been received. The Bullfinch is seldom alluded to, and
so far&mdash;using only the Irish migration reports&mdash;there is little
or no evidence that it migrates at all.</p>

<p>In 1884 an extraordinary movement of Rooks from W. to E.
was observed at the Tearaght and Skelligs in November; it
lasted about three weeks. In 1887, about the same time, a
similar occurrence is mentioned at the same stations. They
are twenty miles apart, and both about nine miles from shore.
There is no land to the westward nearer than America. On
both occasions the birds are said to have appeared tired. On
April 12th, a Hoopoe was shot at Eagle Island, E. (Mr Daniel
Hawkins), off Mayo, and forwarded in the flesh.</p>

<p>From Blackrock (Mayo), Mr Edward Rohu forwarded a
Turtle Dove&mdash;a rare and unexpected visitor in such a locality.
From the Tearaght, Co. Kerry (Mr F. Ryan), the skin of a
Spotted Crake&mdash;very rare in Ireland&mdash;was sent. Bird caught
August 21st.</p>

<p>Between November 8th and 19th the Water Rail occurred at
several stations all round Ireland, except on the W. coast, and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">- 115 -</span>
all cases but one at a considerable distance from shore. Records
authenticated by specimens killed striking.</p>

<p>A Bald Coot was killed striking the Arklow S. light-ship
September 22d, and for the first time this species has appeared
in our reports. Leg and wing received.</p>

<p>Considering the numbers of Woodcock which annually visit
Ireland, the scanty information received from the light-stations
as to its movements is surprising. It is insufficient to enable
any one to form an opinion as to whether it arrives first on the
W. coast or not, but the statement that it does so is contrary
to what might be expected, and until supported by satisfactory
evidence would be prudently omitted from our text
books.</p>

<p>The observations on Gulls are of questionable value. Confusion
between the species is inevitable, but they are continued
in the hope that when the schedules for several years are compared
some tangible fragment may be forthcoming. "Cream-coloured Gulls"
were noted at Slyne Head, S., and at the
Tearaght. They are probably Iceland Gulls, and from previous
migration reports it may be gathered that a few straggle to the
W. coast of Ireland almost every year. A Glaucous Gull is
noted at Blackrock, Mayo, the first time this species has been
definitely mentioned in the schedules. The Fork-tailed Petrel
was found breeding on the Tearaght Rock in very limited
numbers by Mr By an, who kindly forwarded a specimen and its
egg. Particulars are given under this species.</p>

<p>The only stations at which the migratory movements of Wild
Geese are returned in any number, are on the coast of Donegal.
This has always been the case.</p>

<p>The autumn rushes of most species were on a larger scale
than usual, and between the 10th and 13th of November the
greatest migratory movement yet recorded on the Irish coast
took place. As usual the S.E. stations experienced the rush
most, but it was felt on the W. coast also. At the Tuskar
countless numbers of Blackbirds, Thrushes, and Starlings passed.
Chaffinches and Larks and other birds in smaller numbers
accompanied them. The spring movements in February and
March were also better defined than usual, but only a careful
mapping out of the various entries all round the coast would
enable one to make an accurate comparison with previous years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">- 116 -</span></p>

<p>As far as Waders are concerned, there is no evidence derived
from the light-stations to show that they arrive in greater
numbers on our N. coast in the autumn than on our S. and S.E.
coasts.</p>

<p>One or two instances of Gulls chasing and killing small birds
are given in schedules. (See under Skylark and Greenfinch.)</p>

<p>There are several entries of birds killed striking on clear
nights, which is not usual.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the preface to every Report it has been
usual to express our thanks to the Irish light-keepers for their
assistance and co-operation. This year such thanks were never
better deserved. It may be that at times the letters of inquiry,
legs and wings and specimens received from the light-keepers
have remained unacknowledged for a long time. If this has been
the case, it is only due to the great pressure of private business,
between the intervals of which this Report alone can be written,
and not from any wilful negligence or failure to appreciate the
gratuitous services of the observers, for whom this apology is
intended. To Mr Owen Armstrong, the secretary to the Irish
Light Board, and to Captain Boxer, R.N., inspector of Irish
Lights, we are under many obligations. Their co-operation is
as necessary as the sanction of the Irish Light Board to the
continuance of this inquiry, and for both we express our gratitude.</p>

<p><i>Tearaght.</i>&mdash;June 21st, found a Fork-tailed Petrel breeding
on island. Bird caught on egg and forwarded to Mr A. G.
More; egg broken; 23d, found another breeding; egg forwarded.
[The bird referred to on 21st June was received by Mr More,
and the egg found on 23d was received by R. M. B. Both
correctly identified.] Mr Ryan in a letter says:&mdash;"Both birds
had nice nests made of withered grass; I have seen none since,
and think they are very scarce." Subsequently he writes:
"Little nests were formed, but nothing like what land birds
make. The little hollow was lined thinly with grass. I often
found some of the Stormy Petrels with little nests; but again
plenty lay on the bare earth or among loose stone." [Though
I have frequently taken the eggs of the Fork-tailed and
Stormy Petrels, no grass was ever found about them. See
<i>Zoologist</i> 1887, p. 349, as to breeding of Fork-tailed Petrel on
Tearaght.&mdash;R. M. B.]</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
